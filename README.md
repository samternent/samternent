# 👋 Hello, I'm Sam!

An experienced IC Software Developer from England.

- 🦫 I work full-time as a Principal Software Engineer at [Teamwork.com](https://github.com/Teamwork).
- 👨‍💻 I run an open-source, free-to-play, football predictions app at [FootballSocial.app](https://footballsocial.app).
- 🌐 I've been working remotely since 2016.

## Technical

- 🛠️ **I like build tools (and building tools).** I know my way around a build config (be it webpack, rollup or vite) and I love to solve problems at build-time where appropriate.
- 💻 **Javascript.** I've been getting paid to write Javascript for the client for over a decade. I often use node for tooling and automation, along with any server requirements I have.
- 💻 **The browser.** I built my first website in 2001. Building for the browser is my core strength.
- 🖼️ **I'm framework agnostic.** My preference is Vue, I like Svelte, and I can React. _(if you ask nicely you'll find some jquery & knockout knowledge under the hood also)_
- 💻 **I dabble in dev-ops.** I write GHA workflows, docker & compose (build, deploy, run), CD/CI with changesets, nginx configs, Kubernetes backend services and Vercel CDN front ends.
