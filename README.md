# Hello, I'm Sam!

A software enthusiast hailing from England, I've been passionately crafting digital experiences for a significant stretch of time.

## Navigating the Tech Terrain

- 🛠️ **Tool Maestro:** I'm adept with the likes of webpack, rollup, and vite – molding build tools to shape and optimize development journeys.
- 💻 **JavaScript Craftsman:** With over a decade in the field, I craft elegant solutions with the brush of JavaScript, turning concepts into functional beauty.
- 🖼️ **Framework Journeyman:** While Vue is my sanctuary, Svelte and React are landscapes I navigate fluently. And yes, I hold some older scrolls of jQuery & Knockout too.

Beyond the digital realm, you'll find me savouring the outdoors, exploring new coffee blends, and indulging my curiosity in a myriad of subjects. I see each coding challenge as a portal to growth, an opportunity to refine my craft and contribute to the ever-evolving tech tapestry.
