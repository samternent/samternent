## Technical


- 🛠️ **I like build tools.** I know my way around a build config (be it webpack, rollup or vite) and I prefer to solve problems at build-time wherever possible.
- 🖋️ **Javascript.** I've been getting paid to write Javascript for over a decade.
- 🖼️ **I'm framework agnostic.** My preference is Vue, I like Svelte, I can React. _(if you ask nicely you'll find some jquery & knockout knowledge under the hood also)_
- 💻 I write a lot of code.
- 🌐 I've worked remotely since 2016.
